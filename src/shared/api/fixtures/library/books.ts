   description: `Chuck Palahniuk lives in Portland, Oregon. He is the author of four novels. This book marks Palahniuk's literary debut. "Fight Club" is a unique manifesto of the "angry young men" of our time... It is the most stunning and controversial book of the 1990s. A book in which Chuck Palahniuk gives voice not just to "Generation X," but to a disillusioned and embittered "Generation X" that has lost its last illusions. Have you seen the movie "Fight Club"? Then read the book it was based on!`,

   description: `Chuck Palahniuk is a contemporary American writer, best known for his novel "Fight Club." However, Palahniuk's other works, such as "Survivor," "Lullaby," and "Haunted," have also received numerous awards, with some adapted into successful films. Palahniuk's style is distinctive, featuring short, punchy sentences, vivid and memorable imagery, biting satire, and dark humor. "Fight Club" is Chuck Palahniuk's most famous novel. Remember David Fincher's film starring Brad Pitt? It was based on this book. This is a novel of defiance, written against all odds, portraying a generation of embittered people who have lost their sense of right and wrong, good and evil, and their understanding of themselves and those around them. Palahniuk himself calls his "Fight Club" the new "Great Gatsby." So, what are these late 20th-century Gatsbys like?`,

   description: `In just the last decade, humanity has faced a series of devastating disasters, upheavals, and catastrophes that defy even the most imaginative predictions. Sorbonne graduate and New York financial expert Nassim Taleb calls these unpredictable events Black Swans. He argues that such events are the driving force behind both history as a whole and the existence of each individual. To succeed, one must be prepared for them. Immediately after the release of “The Black Swan,” the author demonstrated his "non-theory" brilliantly in practice: during the financial crisis, Taleb's company earned (rather than lost!) half a billion dollars for its investors. However, this book is not an economics textbook. It is the reflections of an extraordinary thinker on life and how to find one's place in it. In a later essay postscript, “On Robustness and Fragility,” Taleb offers a sharp and witty rebuttal to orthodox economists who criticized his anti-theory. The book also includes a collection of Nassim Taleb's aphorisms, providing a brilliant distillation of his original ideas.`,

By the end of the book, you will gain a wealth of knowledge about code. More importantly, you will learn to distinguish between good and bad code. You will understand how to write good code and how to transform bad code into clean, efficient code. The book is divided into three parts. The first part explains the principles, patterns, and techniques of writing clean code, supported by numerous examples. The second part consists of practical exercises of increasing complexity, focusing on cleaning code or refactoring problematic code into a cleaner, more manageable form. The third part is a distilled essence of the book, containing a single chapter with a list of heuristics and "code smells" gathered during the analysis. This part serves as a knowledge base to guide you in reading, writing, and cleaning code.`,

You'll learn about rationality in complex systems and the real world, the concepts of symmetry and asymmetry, and the logic of risk-taking. By redefining familiar concepts like “fair society,” “professional success,” and “personal responsibility,” and unafraid to challenge the egos of recognized idols, Taleb debunks the hypocritical ideas and actions of war interventionists, stock market investors, and religious preachers. Drawing on examples from Hammurabi and Jesus Christ to Roman and Byzantine emperors, Seneca, and Donald Trump, Taleb demonstrates that the most important quality shared by celebrated heroes, selfless saints, and brilliant entrepreneurs is their refusal to shift risks onto others. “I love being surprised. Following the principle of mutual benefit, I invite readers on a journey that I myself would enjoy.” (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)`,

      "Refactoring is a disciplined approach to improving the structural integrity and performance of existing programs. Developed through the efforts of experts in object-oriented programming, this book defines the principles and best practices for refactoring, providing clarity on when and how to delve into code for improvement. Each step in refactoring is straightforward: moving a field from one class to another, extracting a code fragment into its own method, or even shifting code across class hierarchies. While each individual step may seem simple, the cumulative effect of these small changes can dramatically improve a project or even prevent the decay of poorly designed software. Martin Fowler, along with his co-authors, sheds light on the refactoring process, explaining where and when to start the in-depth study of code. The core of the book includes a comprehensive list of over 70 refactoring methods, detailing their motivation and techniques, with practical examples primarily in Java. These methods enable step-by-step code modifications, minimizing risks associated with project development.",

   description: `Before you is the fourth chronicle in the "A Song of Ice and Fire" cycle. An epic, finely crafted saga about the world of the Seven Kingdoms. A world of harsh lands of eternal cold and joyous lands of eternal summer. A world of lords and heroes, warriors and mages, sorcerers and assassins—all united by Fate to fulfill an ancient prophecy. A world of dangerous adventures, great deeds, and intricate political intrigues. The War of the Five Kings has finally ended, and the House Lannister, along with its allies, celebrates its victory. However, peace and tranquility are still far away! The ruler of the North, Robb Stark, managed to suppress the rebellion in the far northern lands, but his kin seem too weak to hold the conquered territories... Once again, bandits, renegades, and surviving rebels are gathering. A deadly threat once again looms over the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms—and vultures are already sensing the approach of a new feast...`,
